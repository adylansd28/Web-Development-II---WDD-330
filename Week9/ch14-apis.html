    <p>Ch14: HTML5 APIs</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom
            attributes that are ignored by the browser.
        </li>
        <li>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to
            hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card.</li>
        <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is
            similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is
            generally easier to use.</li>
        <li>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property
            called localStorage,</li>
        <li>Every time a value is saved to local storage, a storage event is fired   
        </li>
        <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.</li>
        <li>This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby
            places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.</li>
        <li>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server –
            also known as push messaging</li>
        <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system’s
            notifications.</li>
    </ul>

        //Storing information
        localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');

        addEventListener('storage', (event) => {
            console.log(`The ${event.key} was updated from
            ➥ ${event.oldValue} to ${event.newValue} and saved in
            ${event.storageArea}`) }, false);

            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);
