    <p>Ch9: The Window Object</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Every JavaScript environment has a global object</li>
        <li>Any variables that are created
            in the global scope are actually properties of this object</li>
        <li>and any functions are
            methods of it</li>
        <li>In a browser environment the global object is the window object,
            which represents the browser window that contains a web page.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number of
            properties and methods that are supported by all the major browsers
        </li>
        <li>Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe
            has a window object.
        </li>
        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the
            URL of the current page</li>
        <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any
            previously visited pages in the current browser session.</li>
        <li>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and
            methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window</li>
        <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were
            invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol.</li>
        <li>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s 'cookie jar', using the
            document.cookie property
        </li>
        <li>To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie</li>
        <li>To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past</li>
        <li>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first
            parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter</li>
    </ul>
    <script>
        //Get the global object, put "this" in the global scope
        const global = this;

        //Show window Height
       console.log(window.screen.height)

       //write in document an H1 with Hello World
       document.write('<h1>Hello, world!</h1>');
