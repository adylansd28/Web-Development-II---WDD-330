    <p>Notes and excercises for Ch12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</p>

    <ul>
        <li>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through
            JavaScript</li>
        <li>All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API</li>
        <li>The context is the place where your drawing is rendered. Currently, there’s
            only wide support for drawing to a two-dimensional context</li>
        <li>Both strokeStyle and fillStyle are set on
            a context object, and both take one of three values: a string representing a color, a
            CanvasGradient object, or a CanvasPattern object</li>
        <li>We can also draw images onto the canvas element</li>
        <li>Redrawing an image element from the page onto a canvas is fairly unexciting. It’s
            really no different from using an img element</li>
        <li>To make our progress spinner match our page a bit better, we can use a filter in
            Inkscape to make it black and white</li>
        <li>Now that we have set draggable to true, we have to set an event listener for the
            dragstart eventon each image.</li>
