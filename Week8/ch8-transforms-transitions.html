    <p>Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew
            any element on the page
        </li>
        <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These
            functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top
            and left
        </li>
        <li>When you employa translation function,you’re moving elements without impacting
            the flow of the document
        </li>
        <li>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the
            translatex or translatey functions respectively
        </li>
        <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an elementbythe defined factors horizontallythen
            vertically
        </li>
        <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified
            angle value
        </li>
        <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.</li>
        <li>can control the origin from which your transforms are
            applied. This is done using the transform-origin property
        </li>
        <li>Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native
            CSS transitions generallyrequire less client-side processing
        </li>
        <li>The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that
            should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default
        </li>
        <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the
            duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state
        </li>
        <li>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in
            even more granular detail.</li>
        <li>Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay
            before the transition begins
        </li>
        <li>With four transition properties and a vendor prefix, you could wind up with eight
            lines of CSS for a single transition</li>
            <li>The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call.</li>
        <li>Transitions animate elements over time; however, they’re limited in what they can
            do. You can define starting and ending states, but there’s no fine-grained control
            over any intermediate states</li>
        <li>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to
            control each step of an animation via keyframes</li>
        <li>A keyframe is a snapshot
            that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition</li>
        <li>animation-name
            This property is used to attach an animation</li>
        <li>animation-duration
            The animation-duration property defines the length of time</li>
        <li>animation-timing-function
            Like the transition-timing-function property, the animation-timing-function
            determines how the animation will progress over its duration</li>
        <li>animation-iteration-count
            The animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the
            animation will play through</li>
        <li>animation-delay
            The animation-delay propertyis used to define how many millisecondsor seconds
            to wait before the browser begins the animation</li>
        <li>Remember the old maxim, though: just because you can, doesn’t mean you should</li>
