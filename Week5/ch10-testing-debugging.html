    <ul>
        <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
        <li>A programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors occurring, and find
            ways to identify and deal with them quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually
            caused by one of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with
                    which the program is interacting.
                </li>
                <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it
                    could even be as simple as a typo.
                </li>
                <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is
                    unable to handle.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure
            they are minimized as much as possible and fixed promptly
        </li>
        <li>
            We also should try to limit user errors by predicting any possible interactions that may throw an
            error
        </li>
        <li>It might even be argued that user errors are in fact also
            programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way that
            prevents the user from making the error.
        </li>

        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
            program to deal with the error</li>

        <h3>Stack Traces</h3>
        <li>is a sequence of functions or
            method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred</li>
        <li>stack trace will work
            backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original
            function or method that started the sequence.
        </li>

        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the
            program to crash.
        </li>
        <li>his means the program will continue to run after a warning.</li>
        <li>warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.</li>
        <li>Note that not all browsers will display a warning for the code in the example
            above
        </li>
        <li>Warnings and exceptions are presented differently in various environments.</li>
        <li>When a runtime error occurs in the browser, the HTML will still appear, but the
            JavaScript code will stop working in the background, which isn’t always obvious
            at first.
        </li>
        <li>If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will continue to run (although possibly
            incorrectly).
        </li>
        <h3>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <li>JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors</li>
        <li>error might
            give unexpected or incorrect results that nobody spots, or lurk in the background
            for a long time before causing the program to crash spectacularly
        </li>
        <li>Failing silently
            makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down.
        </li>
        <li>programmer should ensure that the code they write fails
            loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly
        </li>
        <li>This is achieved by making sure
            exceptions are caught and dealt with, and code is tested rigorously.
        </li>

        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
        <li>produces more exceptions and
            warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features
        </li>
        <li>This is due to the
            fact that strict mode considers coding practices that were previously accepted as
            just being “poor style” as actual errors.
        </li>
        <li>Increasing the chance of errors might seem like a bad idea at first, but it’s much
            better to spot errors early on, rather than have them cause problems later.
        </li>
        <li>You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a
            function. Strict mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function
        </li>
        <li>In fact, the recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into
            a self-invoking function
        </li>
        <li>Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on all the
            JavaScript in the file. If you’re using anybody else’s code, there’s no
            guarantee they’ve coded in strict mode. This technique will ensure that only your
            code is forced to use strict mode.</li>
        <li>Modules are selfcontained pieces of code that are in strict mode by default, so the 'use strict'
            declaration is not required.
        </li>

        <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
        <li>Linting tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the
            quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.</li>
        <li>They are designed to
            highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain
            if certain style conventions are not followed</li>
        <li>Linting tools
            are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide.</li>
        <li>Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will
            be more consistent and less likely to have problems.</li>

        <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
        <li>You can’t always rely on users having the most up-to-date
            browser</li>
        <li>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use
            feature detection</li>
        <li>Feature detection guarantees that the method is only
            called if it actually exists and fails gracefully, without any exceptions being
            thrown, if the method doesn’t exist.</li>
        <li>The “old-school” way of checking for browser support was known as browser
            sniffing. This involves using the string returned by window.navigator.userAgent</li>
        <li>The
            relevant methods can then be used for that browser. This approach is not
            recommended</li>

        <h3>Error Objects</h3>
        <li>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception
            occurs
        </li>
        <li>These error objects can also be used as constructors to create custom error objects</li>
        <li>It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the
            throw statement</li>
        <li>const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');  </li>

        <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
        <li>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is
            ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors.</li>
        <li>In production,
            however, it will appear as if the program has crashed, which does not reflect well
            on a programmer.</li>
    </ul>
    <script>
        //If I call the function below, without been defined first, it will raise an exception "ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined"
        unicorn();

        //If I put what is below A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence:
        // << index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is
        // ➥ not defined
        // at three (index.html:13)
        // at two (index.html:17)
        // at one (index.html:21)
        // at index.html:24`
        function three(){ unicorn(); }
        function two(){ three(); }
        function one(){ two(); }
        one();

        //Code below will raise a waring "JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable"
        pi = 3.142;

        //This line adds strict mode:
        // This will be picked up by any JavaScript engine that uses strict mode. If the
        // engine does not support strict mode, this string will simply be ignored.
        'use strict';

        //Strict mode is used only inside the function strictly
        function strictly(){
        'use strict';
        }

        //This is the better way to code in strict mode
        (function() {
        'use strict';
        // All your code would go inside this function
        }());

        //This is how to handle an error
        function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
        'use strict';
        let answer;
        try {
        answer = String(squareRoot(number));
        } catch(error) {
        answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";
        } finally {
        return `+ or - ${answer}`;
        }
        }
