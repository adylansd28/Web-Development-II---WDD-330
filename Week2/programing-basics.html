    <p>Notes and excersices for Chapter 2 - Programming Basics:</p>

    <p>
        Variables
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Varibles need to be declared before they can be used</li>
        <li>Assign a value to a varible can be done by the "=" operator</li>
        <li>When we are declaring a varible we use before the varible name "const" or let</li>
        <li>"const" for t is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, if your try it will result in an error</li>
        <li>is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</li>
        <li>We can declare and assign multiple varibles at the same time if we sepaete the by a comma</li>
        <li>We can reassign a "let" varible just using again the "=" operator</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Scope
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are declared in</li>
        <li>It refers to where a constant or variable is accessible by the program. </li>
        <ul>
            <p>Global Scope</p>
            <li>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope. This means it is accessible everywhere in the program.</li>
            <li>it is not considered good practice</li>
            <li>A ninja programmer will try to keep the
                number of global variables to a minimum, because any variables that share the
                same name will clash and potentially overwrite each otherâ€™s values</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <p>Local Scope</p>
            <li>This means that any variables
                defined inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside that
                block and not be accessible outside of that block. This is known as having local
                scope, as the variable is only visible in the locality of the block.</li>
            <li>it is not considered good practice</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Convertirng / Parsing
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>We can convert numbers to strings and vice versa using a variety of methods.
        </li>
        <li>The best way to change a string to a number is to use the Number method. This
            will convert the string form of a number into an actual number:</li>
        <li>This is the preferred way to convert strings to numbers as it avoids type coercion
            in the background. The conversion is also explicit and makes it obvious what is
            being done.
            </li>
        <li>If the string cannot be converted into a number, then NaN is returned</li>
        <li>There are a few tricks that can also be used to convert a string into a number that
            use type coercion</li>
        <li>If a string starts with a number, the parseInt function will use this number and
            ignore any letters that come afterwards:
            </li>
        <li>Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data
            type in order to perform an operation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Template Literals
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Template literals are a special types of string that were introduced in ES6.
            Template literals use the backtick character, `
        </li>
        <li>This has the advantage of being able to use both types of quote mark within the
            string</li>
        <li>They also allow interpolation of JavaScript code. This means that a JavaScript
            expression can be inserted inside a string and the result will be displayed, as can
            be seen in the examples below:</li>
    </ul>
    <script>/* Varibles Exercices */

        /* Declare and assign values to variables */
        
        const name1 = "Alexa";
        let name2 = "Julio";
        
        /* How to reassig */
        
        name2 = "Andres";
        
        /* Multiple varible declaration and assignation */
        
        let position = 12, position2 = 30, position3 = 42;
        
        /* Trying to reassign a const variable */
        
        name1 = "Kayle";
        
        /* Converting String to number*/ 
        
        let numberString = "50";
        let numberNumber = Number(numberString)
        
        /* Parsing */
        
        let binary = parseInt('1010',2);
        
        /* Template Literals */
        
        let string1 = `"Hello" my 'Friend'`;
        </script>
