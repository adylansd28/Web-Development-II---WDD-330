    <p>Notes and excersices for Chapter 4 - Functions</p>

    <p>
        Declaration
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like
            a small, self-contained mini program. Functions can help reduce repetition and
            make code easier to follow
        </li>

        <ul>

            <p>Function Expression</p>

            <li>Another way of defining a function literal is to create a function expression. This
                assigns an anonymous function to a variable
                </li>

            <li>The function in this example is known as an anonymous function because it
                doesn't have a name; it is simply created, then assigned to the variable goodbye</li>

        </ul>

        <ul>

            <p>Function() Constructors</p>

            <li>A function can also be declared using the constructor Function(). The body of
                the function is entered as a string, as shown in this example
                
                </li>

            <li>A function can also be declared using the constructor Function(). The body of
                the function is entered as a string, as shown in this example
                </li>

        </ul>

        <ul>

            <p>Arrow Functions</p>

            <li>These make declaring functions much more succinct by using less verbose
                syntax
                
                </li>

            <li>r. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to
                them, you must assign them to a variable.
                </li>

            <li>They are much less verbose than normal function declarations</li>
            <li>If the function doesn't require any parameters, a pair of empty parentheses must
                go before the arrow:
                </li>

        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Callbacks
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A
            function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback</li>
    </ul>
    
    <script>

        /* Declare Function*/

        function sum(a, b){
            let result = a + b
            return result
        }

        /* Declare a function expression */
        const hello = function(){
        console.log('Hello World!');
        };

        /* Arrow Function*/

        let variable1 = x => 2 * x;  


        /* Callbacks */

        function sing(song,callback) {
        console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`);
        callback();
        }

    </script>
