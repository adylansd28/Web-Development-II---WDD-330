    <p>Notes and excercises for Object Methods: this</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world</li>
        <li>Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties</li>
        <li>A function that is a property of an object is called its method</li>
        <li>we could use a pre-declared function as a method</li>
        <li>When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”.</li>
        <li>It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.</li>
        <li>to access the object, a method can use the this keyword.</li>
        <li>Technically, it’s also possible to access the object without this, by referencing it via the outer variable</li>
        <li>But such code is unreliable. If we decide to copy user to another variable, e.g. admin = user and overwrite user with something else, then it will access the wrong object.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.</li>
    </ul>

            age: 22,
            university: "BYU Idaho"
