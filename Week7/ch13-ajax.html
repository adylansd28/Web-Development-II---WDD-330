    <ul>
        <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a
            server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</li>
        <li>The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory
            argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch.</li>
        <li>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json()
            method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a
            promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</li>
        <li>We can also use Ajax to send information. This can be a variety of formats, but is
            usually a JSON string.</li>
        <li>The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to
            submit information in forms using Ajax.</li>
    </ul>

        const url = 'http://spbooks.github.io/questions.json';
        fetch(url)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(quiz => {
            view.start.addEventListener('click', () => game.start(quiz.questions), false);
            view.response.addEventListener('click', (event) => game.check(event), false);
