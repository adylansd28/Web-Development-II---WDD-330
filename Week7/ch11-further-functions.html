    <p>Notes and excercises for Chapter 11: Further Functions</p>

    <ul>
        <li>functions are first-class objects, which means
            they can be passed around in the same way as every other value.
        </li>
        <li>They can have
            their own properties and methods, as well as accepting other functions as
            parameters and being returned by other functions
        </li>
        <li>all functions have a length property that
            returns the number of parameters the function has.</li>
        <li>There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same
            way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression is
            an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s
            defined, This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function
            definition</li>
        <li>There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it’s been declared. If a
            variable is only required temporarily, it may cause confusion if it’s still available
            later in the code.</li>
        <li>An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for
            again.</li>
        <li>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call
            itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an
            anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</li>
        <li>If any properties have previously been set on the function, these will be lost when
            the function redefines itself.</li>
        <li>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met.</li>
        <li>Async functions were added to the, allow you to write asynchronous code as if it
            was synchronous.</li>
    </ul>

        function square(x) {
            return x*x;
        }

        //this returns 1
        console.log(square.length)

        //Example of an IIFE
        (function(){
            const temp = 'World';
            console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
        })();

        //A function beeing redifined by itself
        function party(){
            console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
            party = function(){
                console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
