        <li>Libraries: A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it
            easier to achieve common tasks
        </li>
        <li>A big advantage of utilizing a popular library is that it will be used by lots of
            people and thoroughly tested. It will most likely have been optimized and battletested
            for nearly every eventuality. Using a library means you can be confident
            that your code will be as bullet-proof as possible in many browsers.</li>
        <li>there will usually be lots of online documentation and a strong community ready
            to help out if you become stuck</li>
        <li>There are some disadvantages to using libraries, however. You need to include

            that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
        <li>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern thatâ€™s been used for a long time
            in server-side languages.</li>
